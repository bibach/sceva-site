        <h3 class="centered" id="monthly_meetings">Monthly Meetings</h3>
        <p>SCEVA members and guests typically meet on the third Saturday of each month for
            a "meet and greet" gathering.  These usually take place at a restaurant in
            mid-to-late morning.  While some club-related announcements might be made,
            the rest of the time is generally left for whatever topics attendees care to
            discuss as a group, or in multiple smaller groups.  Impromptu show-and-tell
            sessions are common!</p>

        <h3 class="centered" id="cars_and_coffee">Cars and Coffee</h3>
        <p>This is a monthly car show organized by another group, which invites the
            SCEVA to be their featured club, a couple of times each year.</p>
        <p>The event usually takes place at the Dunkin' on Hwy A1A in Indialantic,
            Florida, on a Saturday morning.  The location features four 120kW FPL
            EVolution fast chargers with both CCS and CHAdeMO plugs, should you need to
            "fill up" while at the event.</p>
        <p>All makes and models are welcome.  There is no judging or prizes, so just
            bring what you've got to show off and have fun with fellow car enthusiasts
            of all varieties!</p>

        <h3 class="centered" id="ndeem">National Drive Electric Earth Month (NDEEM)</h3>
        <p>For the last several years, the SCEVA has partnered with the <a href="https://www.americanmusclecarmuseum.com/">American
            Muscle Car Museum</a> in Melbourne, Florida to put on this incredible
            event.</p>
        <p>Dealers and representatives of leading EV manufacturers often bring their
            latest models for attendees to explore and maybe test drive.  The Museum
            also opens up their private test track, so attendees can ride shotgun with
            a professional driver in a variety of high-performance electric vehicles.
        <p>Other booths at the event might include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tinting and other automotive customization and detailing services,</li>
            <li>sales and rental companies for electric mobility products (e.g., e-bikes
                and scooters),</li>
            <li>solar power installation and service companies (a fine complement to
                the Museum's impressive solar installation!),</li>
            <li>non-profit and municipal organizations involved in promoting the
                adoption of electrified transportation and other sustainability
                intiatives, and</li>
            <li>FOOD TRUCKS, of course!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The event has previously featured raffles to raise funds for charitable
            causes, in which attendees may choose to participate.  We also highly
            encourage taking the opportunity to tour the Museum's impressive car
            collection and other displays.</p>
